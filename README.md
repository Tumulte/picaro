# What is Picaro ?

It is content management system designed to bridge the gap between specialized (great but limited) CMSÂ and fully customizable frameworks (also great, but requiring to build everything)

It's made to create small but highly customizable web-apps for all your ideas that don't fit the standard formats (blogs, gallery, e-commerce...) without requiring code proficiency 

## ...also it's just a proof of concept 

You can try the software but the main branch is was just a way to make sure it was a good idea

## but it's being built as a stable software

Picaro is currently being rebuilt from the ground up (branch `next`):
[ ] Full TDD
[ ] Break down of the app into standalone modules (so far: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@picaro/colorhelper  https://www.npmjs.com/package/@picaro/colorgenerator )
[ ] Backend change Express -> Fastify
[ ] Conversion to Typescript
[ ] Monorepo
[ ] Removal of Vue to make it framework agnostic thanks to webcomponent (solid, react, vue...)
